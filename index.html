      <p>Hi, I'm Sarah! I am a retired NCAA Divison I volleyball player who bought a house after college and fell in love with all things home improvement. From design, DIY, and thrifting, you can find it all here. I hope this blog will inspire you to create beautiful spaces on a budget.</p>

      <p>What better place to start than the road to home ownership. On my journey as a first time home buyer, I had so many questions and no idea where to begin. To start this story, I attended the University of South Alabama as a NCAA Division I Volleyball player. After graduation, I wasn’t sure what city I wanted to call home, so I moved back in with my parents. I applied for my MBA at the University of Memphis while job searching. What I thought would be only a few weeks turned out to be for the long haul.</p>

      <p>Many people fall victim to not knowing you can refinance your home mortgage after buying a home. When choosing a lending company, it is ideal to find a company that is reputable, reliable, and truly has your best interest at heart. I am so thankful for Freedom Mortgage’s Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Program.</p>
